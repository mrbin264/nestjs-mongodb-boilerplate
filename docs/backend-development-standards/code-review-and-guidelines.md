### Phase 2: Production Readiness (Weeks 3-4)
Implement MEDIUM PRIORITY enhancements:
- [ ] Response caching with Redis
- [ ] Background job processing
- [ ] Comprehensive metrics and monitoring

### Phase 3: Optimization (Weeks 5-6)
Complete LOW PRIORITY enhancements and performance tuning:
- [ ] Database migration system
- [ ] User-specific rate limiting
- [ ] Final performance optimizations
